Code / Folders / Naming - Conventions


General
Named export:

export const TodoList = () => {}



Use interfaces over the types

add I to interface ITodoList  or ITodoListItem


Do not create index.tsx files where it’s not required. Give the proper name, to avoid this situation:


Components
Use PascalCase (capitalizing the first letter of each word) for component names. 

export const TodoList = () => {}

Files
Use kebab-case: All words are in lowercase and separated by hyphens (-).

todo-list.tsx



Variables
State variables - Prefix state variables with is, has, or should for BOOLEAN values

const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false)

const [hasActive, setHasActive] = useState(false)

etc.



Event handlers - Use handle as a prefix for event handler functions

const handleUpdate = () => {}



Functions - Use camelCase for naming

const getUserData = () => {}



Constants - Use  UPPERCASE letters with underscores

const MAX_LIMIT = 10;

const API_URL = “api.com“;



File structure:
Components - follow the atomic design methodology
